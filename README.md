# Logo-Generator
<a href=''></a>

## Description

This project was designed to generate a simple svg file that takes in user input based on text,shape, and colors. Logo-Generator was a project built for practice envolving classes to acheive OOP, Jest to test the classes. Throughout this project I learned how important OOP is in order to acheive the DRY method, so that I can write clean and consice code. Jest also allowed me to understand the importance of testing to make sure the classes are set up to pas correctly.
